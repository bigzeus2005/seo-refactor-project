### Description  
In this project, we were taksed with:  

- Ensuring a given site was up to accessibility standards
- Fixing the HTML elements so that they follow proper semantics and logical structure independent of styling position
- Ensuring the images presented contained accessible alt attributes
- Making sure the heading elements fall in sequential order
- Ensuring the page contained a descriptive title  

After completing these initial tasks. I worked on hitting all the points outlined in the grading criteria. I created a new repository on GitHub titled seo-refactor-project and deployed my changes to the site using the git add, git commit, and git push commands.  

I made sure all the links functioned properly. As well as, consolidated the CSS selectors and properties. I also added notes to my CSS file oultining those changes.  

I deployed the site to a live URL and submitted that link along with my GitHub URL. I also ensured there were no load errors and made sure my GitHub repository contained the application code. As well as, ensured the application resemebled the mock-up provided in the homework instructions.  

Lastly, I gave the repository a unique name, ensuring it followed best practices for file structure and naming conventions, as well as, following best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, and quality comments. I made sure the repository contained multiple descriptive commit messages and a quality README file with a description, screenshot, and a link to the deployed application.
